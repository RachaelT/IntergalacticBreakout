# IntergalacticBreakout
A project I created for my HCS3 (Data Structures) final - it's a breakout game with a variety of powerups to make the experience more interesting:

- Meteor - Your ball passes through blocks for a period of time
- Wide Paddle - Your paddle doubles in width for a period of time
- Multiball - Another ball appears onscreen
- Sticky Ball - Your ball sticks to the paddle for a period of time
- Free Life - An extra life!

Game was created from scratch in Java.
